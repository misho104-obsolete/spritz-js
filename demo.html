Mrs Brooks said she "didn't think anybody, me included, knew it was illegal".

She told the Old Bailey she felt "shock and horror" after she discovered murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked.

Mrs Brooks, one of seven defendants on trial, denies four charges.

She said she was never asked to sanction the accessing of voicemails for a story during her time as editor of the newspaper.

"No journalist ever came to me and said 'We're working on so and so a story but we need to access their voicemail and we need to ask for my sanction to do it'," she said.

"Even though I didn't know it was illegal, I absolutely felt it was in the category of a serious breach of privacy."

Mrs Brooks denies conspiring to hack phones, conspiring to commit misconduct in public office, and conspiring to cover up evidence to pervert the course of justice.</textarea>
